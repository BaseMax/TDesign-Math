# T-Design Math

Research Simple t-designs: A recursive construction for arbitrary t.

## Article / Abstract

The aim of this paper is to present a recursive construction of simple
t−designs for arbitrary t. The construction is of purely combinatorial nature
and it requires finding solutions for the indices of the ingredient designs that
satisfy a certain set of equalities. We give a small number of examples to illus-
trate the construction, whereby we have found a large number of new t−designs,
which were previously unknown. This indicates that the method is useful and
powerful.
